This is a fitness app designed to help users develop an early and active morning routine. 
To motivate them, users are rewarded every morning upon completing the routine. The reward is real money added to their wallet. 
If a user fails to complete the routine on any given day, they will lose money.

The app includes an Android application for users, which utilizes machine learning/artificial intelligence to analyze users' recorded 
sessions to determine if they have fully completed the session. Based on this analysis, users will receive rewards.
